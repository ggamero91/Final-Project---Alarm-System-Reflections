# Final-Project---Alarm-System-Reflections

Challenges

One of the biggest challenges I encountered was building the logic for the project in both Arduino and Python. I did make the mistake of making all the logic in Arduino, thinking that that was the way to do it.
I also had difficulties putting together the code for the connection to the MQTT, that was challenging because up to this day it is a very new thing for me and its a work in progress to fully grasp the way it works and 
how its supposed to be connected to the other devices.



What I learned
I learned a LOT.
- what an esp32 is and what its capable of. I learned how to program it and how to connect it to the network.
- what MQTT is and how to connect it to the esp32 for communication.
- how to operate a raspberry pi, specially working with linux, command line control( i really enjoyed that).
- connecting all those 3 components together was challenging but I must admit that I had a lot of fun learning how to do it
- Creating the webserver, hands down one of the coolest things Ive learned so far in this program.
Once everything was connected (although it wasnt the right way) it looked really good
- setting up the system to boot up automatically when the raspberry starts was also very interesting to learn
- Finally, I learned that having the logic of the alarm system in the Raspberry pi is so much better than having it in the esp32. This is becuase the esp32 is not very goog at handling a lot on information, this is why the first time we did the project it didnt work that well.


Improvements
Double checking all my work before assuming its done. I feel really bad that I made everything on the ESP32 instead of the raspberry pi as intended. I did not realize what I was doing and it caused the code to be bugged.
I believe that I need to be more familiarized with the concepts before I start putting things together, there are a lot things in python and MQTT as well as HTML that need to be handled with care.
I should also start looking for online bootcamps to learn coding. seems like a very importnat thing to learn now.
